**Describe the bug**
As long as the addon is not reviewed by an official team, 
it is not listed/indexed on addons.thunderbird.net. 
You must download and install the .xpi manually via the site or via GitHub (https://github.com/ysard/mintrayr/releases). 
But by doing this, even if new versions are pushed to addons.thunderbird.net your Thunderbird will not be updated.
So please make sure you are using the latest version of the software.

When describing the bug, please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Please check if your problem is related to the issue #7 or #18.
Do not forget that the console can provides additional information (Ctrl + Maj + J).
